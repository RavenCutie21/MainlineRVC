# MainlineRVC Modification

Please download the latest mainline rvc prepackaged binary from here https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/releases

As long as the date on that, doesn't exceed the date on the infer-web.py file, it will work, this is highly stripped down version of mainline, only including INFER and TRAINING tabs. Everything else has been removed.

some tooltips on the train tab have been changed, to be more user friendly, and or explain what to do for newer users. This is still a proof of concept at the end of the day.

Grab both RavenUI.py and RavenUI.bat and place inside of your Mainline RVC folder.

You can use this file anywhere else including colabs or your own forks, as long as you give credit.
