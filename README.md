# MainlineRVC Modification

Please download the latest mainline rvc prepackaged binary from here https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/releases

99.9999% translated, removed ton of changes, added 3 guide recommendations to the top, train tab default, and all defaults changed.

# Installation
Download both files (or clone repo) and place them in the initial RVC folder (or extract them there). thats it :3


# Notice
You're free to use this idea as you see fit, but I will be updating this to keep up to date with whatever prebuilt RVC binary exists, until I quit making models, just give Credit if you do use it and change stuff.
