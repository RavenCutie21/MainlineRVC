# MainlineRVC Modification

Please download the latest mainline rvc prepackaged binary from here https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/releases

As long as the date on that, doesn't exceed the date on the infer-web.py file, it will work, this is highly stripped down version of mainline, only including INFER and TRAINING tabs. Everything else has been removed.

some tooltips on the train tab have been changed, to be more user friendly, and or explain what to do for newer users. This is still a proof of concept at the end of the day.

Remember to backup your infer-web.py file as a just in case. Using my file, opening the assets folder, you can make it match the screenshot located in this repo.

You can use this file anywhere else, as long as you give credit.
