# MainlineRVC Modification

Please download the latest mainline rvc prepackaged binary from here https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/releases

you can download this repo as a zip, and extract it inside of your freshly installed mainlined RVC, and have my slimmed down UI, with better defaults.



You're free to use this idea as you see fit, but I will be updating this to keep up to date with whatever prebuilt RVC binary exists, until I quit making models.
